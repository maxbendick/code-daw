* Binding brainstorming
** each interactable in runtime has an index
** each coolzone instance knows it's own index?
** need to crossreference coolzone instances with dial instances
   component will get start/end/default
** first, need a basic runtime
** multiple dials on one line -> error in runtime?
** need to error if in loop/function or multiple 
   calls for one call expression 
** can error if token doesn't match interactable runtime function

* Runtime brainstorming
** compile with tsc
** run with eval
** need to add runtime dependencies (audio-signals.js, etc.)
** need to create runtime files
** need cross-communication between evaled files and rest of program
** send dial updates to runtime
** consider messages sent from runtime, like for gain meters
** buses are visible to runtime based off code analysis before eval

** mvp:
*** tsc to compile to JS
*** remove types only?
*** use global eval + window to communicate, share lib
*** remove imports before compilation?
*** configure tsc? tslib? 

** steps
*** make runtime evaluate fine
*** remove types from input code
*** remove imports, add stuff to window based on imports
*** eval code in browser

* Future
** use ts language service for highlighting, binding
** sanitize input code
** convert imports to declaring from window?

react doesnt have 1st class reactivity

make a higher-order component that takes in normal props
and its argument takes in observable args.

original args: 
{ creen: number, editor: EditorT, boofs }

injected args:
{ creen$: Observable<number>, creen: number
, editor$: Observable<EditorT>, editor: EditorT
, boofs$: Observable<any>, boofs: any
}


make a fn that takes in observables and a fn from raw
values to jsx, and returns a component applied with
connected props

// better to just use observable-hook
return injectBoofs([creen$, boofs$], (creen, boofs) => {
  return <div>{creen}</div>
})
